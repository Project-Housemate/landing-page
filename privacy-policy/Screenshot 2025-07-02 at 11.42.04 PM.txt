6. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?
In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.

We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By
using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor
dependentâ€™s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate
the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected
from children under age 18, please contact us at adamwax06@gmail.com.
