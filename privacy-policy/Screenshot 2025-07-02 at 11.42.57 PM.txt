How to Exercise Your Rights

To exercise these rights, you can contact us by visiting adamwax06@gmail.com, by emailing us at adamwax06@gmail.com, or by referring to the
contact details at the bottom of this document.

Under certain US state data protection laws, you can designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. We may deny a request from
an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with applicable laws.

Request Verification

Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our
system. We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. However, if we
cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of
verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes.

If you submit the request through an authorized agent, we may need to collect additional information to verify your identity before processing your

request and the agent will need to provide a written and signed permission from you to submit such request on your behalf.
Appeals

Under certain US state data protection laws, if we decline to take action regarding your request, you may appeal our decision by emailing us at
adamwax06@gmail.com. We will inform you in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of

the reasons for the decisions. If your appeal is denied, you may submit a complaint to your state attorney general.
